    "text": "Hi, There! I’m a tech enthusiast and robotics geek on a mission to make machines see and think like never before. As a PhD candidate in Computer Science, I get a total kick out of solving mind-bending challenges in computer vision and robotics. Picture me diving deep into algorithms, teaching robots to perceive the world, and basically living at the coolest intersection of AI and visual intelligence. When I’m not geeking out over cutting-edge tech, I’m all about learning, experimenting, and turning seemingly impossible problems into “wow, we actually did that!” moments. My ultimate goal? To create smart systems that can understand and interact with the world in ways that’ll make sci-fi movies look like child’s play. Robots, algorithms, and endless curiosity – that’s my jam!"
