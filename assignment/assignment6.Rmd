## Image Super-Resolution {#Image_Super_Resolution}

* ***Purpose***: Explore the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Super-Resolution GANs (SRGANs) for image super resolution, which can enhance the quality of low-resolution images.

* ***Challenge***: Train the GAN and SRGAN models effectively, as they require large amounts of high-quality training data and careful tuning of hyper parameters to achieve good results.
