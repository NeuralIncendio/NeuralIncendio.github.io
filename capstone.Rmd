# Capstone Project

The capstone project is a crucial aspect of the course, providing students with a valuable opportunity to apply their deep learning skills to real-world issues. This project serves as a culmination, allowing students to demonstrate their proficiency gained throughout the course and showcase their ability to independently implement, debug, and deploy production-ready deep learning models using PyTorch. The project's comprehensive nature involves the application of deep learning techniques to diverse domains like computer vision, NLP, speech recognition, or music generation. By challenging students to think critically and creatively, the project encourages the development of innovative solutions for complex problems. Functioning as a vital assessment method, the capstone project enables students to exhibit their problem-solving and troubleshooting skills, affirming their readiness to apply deep learning in real-world scenarios. Students have the flexibility to suggest project topics, and depending on class size, collaborative teamwork may be encouraged to better prepare them for the job market. The capstone project, therefore, not only assesses academic knowledge but also emphasizes practical application and the ability to address challenges in a professional context.
